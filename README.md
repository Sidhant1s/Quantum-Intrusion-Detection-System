## 📄 Overview

The **Quantum Intrusion Detection System (QIDS)** is a conceptual passive detection framework capable of identifying unauthorized encrypted quantum communication in natural environments—without collapsing the signal. It separates structured quantum data from background noise using AI-driven photon behavior analysis and passive decoding attempts.

Developed by **Sidhant Negi**, QIDS is suited for defense, strategic surveillance, and satellite infrastructure.

## 🧠 Key Modules

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **QSDL – Quantum Shadow Detection Layer** | Detects photon streams and filters them by polarization, intensity, and spectral behavior. |
| **QPRE – Quantum Pattern Recognition Engine** | AI/ML module trained to identify entropy and time-based patterns in photon behavior to flag encrypted quantum data. |
| **QDP – Quantum Decoding Probe** | Applies non-invasive decoding logic to test the stream’s structure without collapsing the signal. |
| **QELM – Evidence Logging Module** | Logs signal metadata for forensic review and legal tracking. |
| **QTLS – Quantum Transmission Localization System (Optional)** | Estimates source/destination of quantum streams using time-of-arrival triangulation. |
